    "In the diagram above, we're deciding whether we should wrestle a bear that's in front of us. We're using various criteria to make our final decision, including the size of the bear, and whether escape is possible. Let's say we had a data set of people who survived bear encounters and the actions they took:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    "Bear name    Size    Escape possible?    Action\n",
    "Yogi         Small   No                  Wrestle\n",
    "Winnie       Small   Yes                 Wrestle\n",
    "Baloo        Large   Yes                 Run away\n",
    "Gentle Ben   Large   No                  Wrestle\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to optimize our chances of surviving a bear encounter, we could construct a decision tree to tell us what action to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "As our data set gets larger though, this becomes less and less practical. What if we had 10000 rows and 10 variables? Would you want to look through all of the possibilities to construct a tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the decision tree machine learning algorithm can help. It enables us to automatically construct a decision tree that tells us what outcomes we should predict in certain situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm -- we first construct the tree with historical data, and then use it to predict an outcome. One of the major advantages of decision trees is that they can pick up nonlinear interactions between variables in the data that linear regression can't. In our bear wrestling example, a decision tree can pick up on the fact that you should only wrestle large bears when escape is impossible, whereas a linear regression would have had to weight both factors in the absence of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use trees for classification or regression problems. In this lesson, we'll walk through the building blocks of making a decision tree automatically."

Another example of a column of categories is **sex**, where the options are **Male** and **Female**.\n",

Under this approach, pandas will display the labels as strings, but internally store them as numbers so we can do computations with them. The numbers aren't always compatible with other libraries like Scikit-learn, though, so it's easier to just do the conversion to numeric upfront.\n",

    "Because we're trying to reach the leaves having only **1s** or only **0s** in **high_income**, each split will need to get us closer to that goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we split, we'll try to separate as many **0s** from **1s** in the high_income column as we can. In order to do this, we need a metric for how \"together\" the different values in the **high_income** column are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientists commonly use a metric called entropy for this purpose. Entropy refers to disorder. The more \"mixed together\" 1s and 0s are, the higher the entropy. A data set consisting entirely of 1s in the high_income column would have low entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy, which is not to be confused with entropy from physics, comes from [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory). Information theory is based on probability and statistics, and deals with the transmission, processing, utilization, and extraction of information. A key concept in information theory is the notion of a bit of information. One bit of information is one [unit of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_information).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent a bit of information as a binary number because it either has the value **1** or **0**. Suppose there's an equal probability of tomorrow being sunny (**1**) or not sunny (**0**). If I tell you that it will be sunny, I've given you one bit of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also think of entropy in terms of information. If we flip a coin where both sides are heads, we know upfront that the result will be heads. We gain no new information by flipping the coin, so entropy is 0. On the other hand, if the coin has a heads side and a tails side, there's a 50% probability that it will land on either. Thus, flipping the coin gives us one bit of information -- which side the coin landed on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy can be much more complex, especially when we get to cases with more than two possible outcomes, or differential probabilities. A deep understanding of entropy isn't necessary for constructing decision trees, however. If you'd like, you can read more about entropy [at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy).\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for entropy looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$−\\sum_{i=1}^{c}P(x_i)\\log⁡_b{P(x_i)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterate through each unique value in a single column (in this case, **high_income**), and assign it to i. We then compute the probability of that value occurring in the data (P(xi)). Next we do some multiplication, and sum all of the values together. b is the base of the logarithm. We commonly use the value **2** for this, but we can also set it to **10** or another value.\n",

    "==\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll need a way to go from computing entropy to figuring out which variable to split on. We can do this using information gain, which tells us which split will reduce entropy the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the formula for information gain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$IG(T,A)=Entropy(T)−\\sum_{v\\in A}\\frac{\\left |T_v \\right |}{\\left |T\\right | }Entropy(T_v)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It may look complicated, but we'll break it down. We're computing information gain (IG) for a given target variable (T), as well as a given variable we want to split on (A).\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute it, we first calculate the entropy for T. Then, for each unique value v in the variable A, we compute the number of rows in which A takes on the value v, and divide it by the total number of rows. Next, we multiply the results by the entropy of the rows where A is v. We add all of these subset entropies together, then subtract from the overall entropy to get information gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an alternate explanation. We're finding the entropy of each set post-split, weighting it by the number of items in each split, then subtracting from the current entropy. If the result is positive, we've lowered entropy with our split. The higher the result is, the more we've lowered entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy for constructing trees is to create as many branches at each node as there are unique values for the variable we're splitting on. So if the variable has three or four values, we'd end up with three or four branches. This approach usually involves more complexity than it's worth and doesn't improve prediction accuracy, but it's worth knowing about.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the calculation of information gain and make splits simpler, we won't do it for each unique value. We'll find the median for the variable we're splitting on instead. Any rows where the value of the variable is below the median will go to the left branch, and the rest of the rows will go to the right branch. To compute information gain, we'll only have to compute entropies for two subsets.\n",
