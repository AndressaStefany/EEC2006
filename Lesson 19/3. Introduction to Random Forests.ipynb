    "We were able to improve the AUC from 0.735 to 0.738, but the model using 150 trees took much longer to train. While the extra training time is trivial on the data set we're working with right now, understanding this trade-off will help you when you're working with much larger data sets where the extra time could amount to hours or days!\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major advantages of random forests over single decision trees is that they tend to overfit less. Although each individual decision tree in a random forest varies widely, the average of their predictions is less sensitive to the input data than a single tree is. This is because while one tree can construct an incorrect and overfit model, the average of 100 or more trees will be more likely to hone in on the signal and ignore the noise. The signal will be the same across all of the trees, whereas each tree will hone in on the noise differently. This means that the average will discard the noise and keep the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code cell, you'll see that we've fit a single decision tree to the training set, and made predictions for both the training and testing sets. The AUC for the training set predictions is .819, while the AUC for the testing set is .714. The fact that the test AUC is much lower than the train AUC indicates that the model is overfitting.\n",

    "As we can see in the code cell from the previous screen, overfitting decreased with a random forest, and accuracy went up overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the random forest algorithm is incredibly powerful, it isn't applicable to all tasks. The main strengths of a random forest are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very accurate predictions - Random forests achieve near state-of-the-art performance on many machine learning tasks. Along with neural networks and gradient-boosted trees, they're typically one of the top-performing algorithms.\n",
    "- Resistance to overfitting - Due to their construction, random forests are fairly resistant to overfitting. We still need to set and tweak parameters like max_depth though.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main weaknesses of using a random forest are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They're difficult to interpret - Because we've averaging the results of many trees, it can be hard to figure out why a random forest is making predictions the way it is.\n",
    "- They take longer to create - Making two trees takes twice as long as making one, making three takes three times as long, and so on. Fortunately, we can exploit multicore processors to parallelize tree construction. Scikit allows us to do this through the **n_jobs** parameter on [RandomForestClassifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html). We'll discuss parallelization in greater detail later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these trade-offs, it makes sense to use random forests in situations where accuracy is of the utmost importance; being able to interpret or explain the decisions the model is making isn't key. In cases where time is of the essence or interpretability is important, a single decision tree may be a better choice."
