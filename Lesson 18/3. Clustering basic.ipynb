    "\n",
    "So far, we've looked at regression and classification. These are both types of [supervised machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning). In supervised learning, you train an algorithm to predict an unknown variable from known variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major type of machine learning is called [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning). In unsupervised learning, we aren't trying to predict anything. Instead, we're finding patterns in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main unsupervised learning techniques is called clustering. We use clustering when we're trying to explore a dataset, and understand the connections between the various rows and columns. For example, we can cluster NBA players based on their statistics. Here's how such a clustering might look:\n",

    "The clusters made it possible to discover player roles that might not have been noticed otherwise. [Here's](https://flowingdata.com/2012/03/21/redefining-nba-basketball-positions/) an article that describes how the clusters were created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering algorithms group similar rows together. There can be one or more groups in the data, and these groups form the clusters. As we look at the clusters, we can start to better understand the structure of the data.\n",

    "Clustering is a key way to explore unknown data, and it's a very commonly used machine learning technique. In this mission, we'll work on clustering US Senators based on how they voted."

    "The most extreme Senators are those who are the furthest away from one cluster. For example, a radical Republican would be as far from the Democratic cluster as possible. Senators who are in between both clusters are more moderate, as they fall in between the views of the two parties.\n",

The higher the exponent we raise a set of numbers to, the more separation we'll see between small values and low values. For instance, squaring [1,2,3] results in [1,4,9], and cubing it results in [1,8,27].\n",

If we left the distances as is, we'd end up with 3.4 + .24 = 3.64, and 2.6 + 2 = 4.6, which would make the moderate, who is between both parties, seem extreme. If we cube, we instead end up with $3.4^ 3 + .24^3 = 39.3$, and $2.6^3 + 2^3 = 25.5$, which correctly identifies the extremist.\n",
