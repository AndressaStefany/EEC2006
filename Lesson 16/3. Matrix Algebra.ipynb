For the first value in that row, we \"hide\" the other values in that row (2nd and 3rd value in the row) and in that column (2nd and 3rd value in the column), select the rest of the elements as the minor matrix, and multiply the scalar value with the determinant of the minor matrix. We repeat this for the remaining values in the first row. This diagram helps illustrate this much clearer:\n",
